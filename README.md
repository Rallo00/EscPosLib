# What is this library?
This library allows ethernet printing on ESC/POS printers using C#.

# The Idea
- I could not find a simple C# library to print stuff on thermal printer via Ethernet, so I created this one.


This latest version allows:
- Layout personalisation (some very basic functions, will be improved);
- Font selection (by using standard provided fonts);
- Styles selection (Bold, underlined, ...);
- Justification;
- Barcode (1D) printing;
- QR Code printing;
- Image printing;
- Receipt printing;
- Printing with different alphabets;

# Requisites
- .Net Framework SDK v4.8

# How to use
Please check the wiki for further information.
Thank you.
